# THM - Metasploit:Exploitation

## Introduction

For this room there is a wordlist that can be downloaded if you want to run the room over a VPN connection, but the same wordlist is in the Attackbox under ```/usr/share/wordlists/MetasploitRoom/MetasploitWordlist.txt```

Start the Attackbox (or local VPN connection) and run ```msfconsole``` to start the room

## Scanning

After the machine loads and the msfconsole has started, search for port scanners by running ```search portscan```

For the demonstration we will be using ```auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp```

Start it with ```use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp```
